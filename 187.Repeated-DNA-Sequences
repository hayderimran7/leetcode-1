/*
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

Example:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        vector<string> rst;
        unordered_map<size_t,int> mp;
        hash<string> hash_fn;

        for(int i = 0; i < int(s.size()) - 9; ++i)
            if(mp[hash_fn(s.substr(i,10))]++ == 1)
               rst.push_back(s.substr(i,10));

        return rst;
    }
};
